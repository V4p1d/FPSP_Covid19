Simulations for the FPSP paper.
These simulations were performed using Matlab 2017b, 2019a, 2019b and 2020a.
The libraries needed to simulate this code can be found at https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41372-hybrid-equations-toolbox-v2-04.
If you want to modify the code, a quick tutorial on the hybrid solver for switched systems can be found at https://www.mathworks.com/videos/hyeq-a-toolbox-for-simulation-of-hybrid-dynamical-systems-81992.html



The models used in these simulations refer to the spread of the Covid19 and were both validated using the data from the Italian outbreak https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.

The folders are organised as follows: 

- SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_Heatmap contains the files needed to generate Figures 5 and 7. Execute the Main file;

- SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_policy_distribution contains the files needed to generate Figure 2 (lower panels). Execute the main file and then execute peakDistributionImage.m in 
SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_policy_distribution\ImageCreation;

- SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_OuterLoop contains the files needed to generate Figures 3. Execute the Main file;

- SIQR/SIQR_1_14 contains the files to simulate the SIQR model for FPSP policies from X=1 working days and Y=1 quarantine days to X=14 working days and Y=14 quarantine days with increments of 1 day.
The main file to execute is "./SIQR_1_14/Main.m". 
Images are generated by "./SIQR_1_14/ImageGeneration_SIQR_1_14.m" and by "./SIQR_mixed/ImageGenerationMixed.m" (see below) after running the main file.

- SIQR/SIQR_7_14 contains the files to simulate the SIQR model for FPSP policies from X=1 working days and Y=1 quarantine days to X=98 working days and Y=98 quarantine days with increments of 7 days.
The main file to execute is "./SIQR_7_14/Main.m". 
Images are generated by "./SIQR_7_14/ImageGeneration_SIQR_7_14.m" and by "./SIQR_mixed/ImageGenerationMixed.m" (see below) after running the main file.

- SIQR/SIQR_mixed contains the file "ImageGenerationMixed.m" which is used to create joint images using data both of SIQR_1_14 and SIQR_7_14. It requires both "./SIQR_1_14/Main.m" and "./SIQR_7_14/Main.m" to be ran first.

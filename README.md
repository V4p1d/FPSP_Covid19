# Simulations for the FPSP paper.
The models used in these simulations refer to the spread of the Covid19 and were both validated using the data from the Italian outbreak (see [GitHub](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19)).

A description of the SIDARTHE can be found in this [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0883-7).
A description of the SIQR can be found on [Research Gate]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339915690_Quantifying_undetected_COVID-19_cases_and_effects_of_containment_measures_in_Italy_Predicting_phase_2_dynamics).

## Prerequisits

### MATLAB

Simulations were performed using Matlab 2017b, 2019a, 2019b and 2020a.
The libraries needed to simulate this code can be found [here](https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41372-hybrid-equations-toolbox-v2-04).
If you want to modify the code, a quick tutorial on the hybrid solver for switched systems can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/hyeq-a-toolbox-for-simulation-of-hybrid-dynamical-systems-81992.html).

### Python

Figure 2 (top) and Figures 10-15 in Methods were generated using Python.

It is assumed that [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is installed.
```
conda create -n fpsp python=3.7
conda activate fpsp
conda install jupyter nb_conda_kernels
```

The following packages are required to be installed within the new conda environment.

`pip install numpy matplotlib scipy`

In order to execute a python notebook, activate the conda environment, navigate to the root folder of the repository and start jupyter.

```
cd <repository root>
conda activate fpsp
jupyter notebook
```

## Structure

The folders are organised as follows: 

- `notebooks/Figure_2_(top).ipynb` generates the top of Figure 2 in the main body.
- `notebooks/Methods_sensitivity_analysis` performs sensitivity analysis simulations and generates Figures 10-15 in the Methods Section.
- `SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_Heatmap` contains the files needed to generate Figures 5 and 7. Execute the Main file;
- `SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_policy_distribution` contains the files needed to generate Figure 2 (bottom). Execute the main file and then execute peakDistributionImage.m in 
`SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_policy_distribution\ImageCreation`;
- `SIDARTHE\SIDARTHE_OuterLoop` contains the files needed to generate Figures 3. Execute the Main file;
- `SIQR/SIQR_1_14` contains the files to simulate the SIQR model for FPSP policies from X=1 working days and Y=1 quarantine days to X=14 working days and Y=14 quarantine days with increments of 1 day.
    - The main file to execute is `SIQR_1_14/Main.m`. 
    - Images are generated by `SIQR/SIQR_1_14/ImageGeneration_SIQR_1_14.m` and by `SIQR/SIQR_mixed/ImageGenerationMixed.m` (see below) after running the main file.
- `SIQR/SIQR_7_14` contains the files to simulate the SIQR model for FPSP policies from X=1 working days and Y=1 quarantine days to X=98 working days and Y=98 quarantine days with increments of 7 days.
    - The main file to execute is `SIQR/SIQR_7_14/Main.m`. 
    - Images are generated by `SIQR/SIQR_7_14/ImageGeneration_SIQR_7_14.m` and by `SIQR/SIQR_mixed/ImageGenerationMixed.m` (see below) after running the main file.
- `SIQR/SIQR_mixed` contains the file `ImageGenerationMixed.m` which is used to create joint images using data both of SIQR_1_14 and SIQR_7_14. It requires both `SIQR/SIQR_1_14/Main.m" and `SIQR_7_14/Main.m` to be run first.
